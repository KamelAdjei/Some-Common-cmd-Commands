# Test-Connection-Using-Ping


Type the command **ping** and web address (google.com) and press **Enter**

The results display the following details.
Packets Sent, Received, Lost (n% loss) and Round trip time

If the connection is unsuccessful, the result will be **Request timed out**

_ping sends 32 bytes of data as 4 packets to the ip address. If the 4 packets are received back, that means the connection is live. Sometimes, not all packets are received back. If none of the packets are received back it means the connection could not be established._
